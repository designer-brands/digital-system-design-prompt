As a DBI engineer, you'll be asked to think critically about solution design as part of your everyday job. We treat architecture as a competency for all members of the team, not just the responsibility of the Architect position. It's up to each member of the team to break down problems and make smart technology decisions.

This prompt is designed to gauge your critical thinking when it comes to
architecting a solution.

## The Problem

In the eCommerce industry, it's important to communicate information to your
customers around the status of their order. We'd like you to design a system
that can deliver operational messages to customers.

## Requirements

The messaging system should have the following capabilities:

- Register user contact information ("opt in")
- Deliver messages across email, SMS, and push notification channels
- Trigger messages from events such as Order Placed, Order Shipped, etc.
- Format the content of each message dynamically based on available information
- Track the historical log of messages that have been sent to each user

Internal users should be able to control the behavior of the system through a
GUI.

Client applications should be able to interact with the system through an HTTP
API.

## Deliverable

Take 5 minutes to evaluate the requirements, form a response, and take any
personal notes.

Feel free to ask questions to narrow down the requirements and context of the solution environment.

Then, please verbally describe your proposed solution and any special considerations or decision points that are worth emphasizing.

There's no right answer here. It's not a presentation, but a collaborative discussion. Simply share what goes through your head as you tackle this problem.

You do not need to provide specific tools, documentation, or diagrams.

## Evaluation Criteria

You'll be evaluated on the following criteria:

- Understanding of the requirements & overall goal of the solution
- Breaking down of the problem into manageable units
- Organization of system components
- Communication of proposed solution design
- Evaluation of multiple possible approaches
- Consideration of external dependencies
- Recognition of decision points
- Identification of missing information
