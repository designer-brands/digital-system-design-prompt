As a DBI engineer, you'll be asked to think critically about solution design as part of your everyday job. We treat architecture as a competency for all members of the team, not just the responsibility of an Architect position. It's up to each engineer to break down problems and make smart technology decisions.

This prompt is designed to gauge your critical thinking when it comes to
architecting a solution.

## The Problem

In the eCommerce industry, it's important to communicate information to your
customers around the status of their order.

We'd like you to design a messaging system with us that can deliver SMS, email, and mobile push notifications to users for events like new orders, shipped orders, and refunded orders.

## Process

Take 5 minutes to evaluate the requirements, form a response, and take any
personal notes. Feel free to ask questions to narrow down the requirements and context of the solution environment.

Then, please verbally describe your proposed solution and any special considerations or decision points that are worth emphasizing.

There's no right answer here. It's not a presentation, but a collaborative discussion. Simply share what goes through your head as you tackle this problem.

You do not need to provide specific tools, documentation, or diagrams.

## Evaluation Criteria

You'll be evaluated on the following criteria:

- Understanding of the solution goal
- Breaking down of the problem into meaningful requirements
- Organization of system components
- Communication of proposed solution design
- Analysis of possible approaches
- Consideration of external dependencies
- Recognition of decision points
